# Realized Covariance and Minimum Variance Portfolios

Welcome to the project folder of David and Jared’s realized covariance work!

## Contents and Description

1) Data is provided in the “Data” folder.  These are daily realized covariance matrices for the year 2007.  Have fun!

2) Code is contained in this folder.  The script runs from Portfolios.R, and the ADMM.R file contains an ADMM algorithm that is tailored to minimum variance portfolio optimization.  In order to get Portfolios.R to run, you need to adjust the dimensions of the covariance list and returns matrix.

## Raw High Frequency and Returns Data / Data pre-processing code

Unfortunately, this raw data obtained from CRSP and the Trade-and-Quote database is proprietary.  The pre-processing R code and scripts are also proprietary. Please contact either of us if you wish to obtain the code and/or data. Our emails are david.puelz@utexas.edu and jared.fisher@utexas.edu.
